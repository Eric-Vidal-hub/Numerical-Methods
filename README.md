# Numerical Methods

In this repository, there is an introduction to MATLAB programming. Afterward, a small project about a damped string is performed, to enhance the recently acquired skills. Then, the numerical methods basics are studied (not all the files are working properly). Finally, a bigger project is presented on *Computing the one-dimensional model of an electron scattered by a quantum junction*.
